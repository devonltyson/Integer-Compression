# Integer-Compression
Compresses 32 bit positive non-zero integers from a text file using the SigByte method.<BR>
The program is used to take numbers from a text file, find the gaps between them, and compress the gaps file.<BR>
The original text files are composed of page numbers from hits on a specific search term.<BR><BR>
  
Future updates:<BR>
I have hardcoded one file to test on at a time, but will make it to where any file can be used, so long as the format is correct.<BR>
Will be implementing decompression method soon.<BR>
Code is written in Java right now, but looking into moving to C.
